### ⚠️ **1. Arbitrary File Deletion (`os.remove`)**

```python
if args.output and os.path.exists(args.output):
    os.remove(args.output)
```

**Risk**: If a malicious user passes a critical file path (e.g. `C:\Windows\system32\config.sys`), it gets wiped.
**Fix**: Sanitize/validate output paths. Ensure it's not a sensitive system file or outside expected scope.

---

### ⚠️ **2. Relative Path Manipulation**

```python
os.path.relpath(path, self.relative_path)
```

If `self.relative_path` is messed with (via CLI), `relpath` may evaluate to something outside intended directory.

**Risk**: Path traversal/logic bypass.
**Fix**: Canonicalize and validate `self.relative_path` at init.

---

### ⚠️ **3. `open(..., 'a')` to User-Specified Output File**

```python
with open(output_file, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f:
```

**Risk**:

* Overwriting arbitrary files
* Appending to log files or scripts maliciously
* Symlink attacks (on Unix)

**Fix**: Use stricter permissions or validate the path doesn’t resolve outside a safe base dir.

---

### ⚠️ **4. Blind `os.path.getsize()`**

```python
os.path.getsize(full_path)
```

**Risk**: Could raise `OSError` (e.g., broken symlink, inaccessible file), potentially crashing the app.
**Fix**: Wrap in `try-except`.

---

### ⚠️ **5. `input()` Blocking in Error Path**

```python
print_stacktrace = input("Want to print stacktrace(Y/n)")
```

**Risk**: On error, it blocks, which can lead to **hanging behavior** if this runs in a service or script.
**Fix**: Avoid interactive prompts in production scripts. Use flags/env vars instead.

---

### ⚠️ **6. No Output File Path Escaping / Quoting**

If filenames contain special chars (e.g. newline, escape sequences), writing them to a log file could lead to **log injection** attacks.

**Fix**: Sanitize file names before writing, or use quoting/escaping.

---

### ⚠️ **7. No Symlink Handling**

You're blindly recursing into directories:

```python
if os.path.isdir(full_path):
```

**Risk**: Could follow symlinks to outside the tree or even into cycles (infinite loops).

**Fix**: Use `os.path.islink()` and optionally skip or limit symlink recursion.

---

### ⚠️ **8. Unicode Printing Failures**

```python
print(text)
```

**Risk**: Partial crash/garbled output on terminals that don't support UTF-8. You handle this, but only once.

**Fix**: Good start, but maybe add an env/config flag to force ASCII mode for safety.

---

### ✅ Other Stuff (Good Practices)

* You handle `PermissionError` gracefully.
* Decent use of argparse.
* Handles KeyboardInterrupt cleanly.
* Help message is clear and covers edge cases.
